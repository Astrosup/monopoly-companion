### Next Steps I can do for you:
1.  **Add Data Persistence:** I can modify the code to save the game state to `localStorage`, so if you accidentally refresh the browser, you don't lose the game.
2.  **Add Dice Roller:** I can add a digital dice roller to the home screen if you don't have physical dice.
3.  **Edit Defaults:** I can help you change the default player names (Red/Blue/etc.) to specific names you use often.
